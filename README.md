# Game-Programming-Course-Week-5
In the fifth week of the Game Programming course, I expanded on my Unity skills by transitioning from 3D to 2D gameplay. This project focused on building foundational 2D game mechanics and visual elements. Key accomplishments include:

- Importing Materials, Audio, and Sprites assets to enhance game visuals and audio feedback.
- Using 2D and 3D views to work efficiently on both perspectives, with sprites specifically used to create a consistent background.
- Organizing layers with sorting to ensure that game objects display correctly in the 2D view.
- Recreating Player, Enemy, and Laser objects in 2D, including resizing and reorienting for 2D movement.
- Adapting C# scripts for 2D functionality and behaviors, including movement and collision in a 2D environment.
- Creating new prefabs for the Enemy and Laser objects to streamline spawning and reusability in-game.
  
This project strengthened my understanding of 2D gameplay in Unity, from handling assets and layers to converting 3D mechanics into a 2D context, preparing me for future, more complex projects.
